# Project Check List

## Catalog Frontend Rebuild

- [x] Units page, form, API hooks, types, and translations are present.
- [x] Price Groups page, form, API hooks, types, navigation, and translations are present.
- [x] Variation Templates page, form, API hooks, types, navigation, and translations are present.
- [x] Rack Locations page, form, API hooks, types, navigation, warehouse filtering, and translations are present.
- [x] Rack Locations focused backend test and frontend type-check verified.
- [x] Products page, form, API hooks, types, navigation, CRUD states, filters, and translations are present.
- [x] Products focused backend test, frontend type-check, and frontend lint verified.
- [x] Product create/edit now uses dedicated page forms instead of a large modal.
- [x] Variable product items use a generated variation matrix table from selected template values.
- [x] Product page form is split into maintainable section components under `frontend/src/features/products/components/`.
- [x] Product backend field contract audited against requests, resources, service, model fillables, and old frontend multipart payload behavior.
- [x] Product form covers backend-supported image upload, rack location, sub-unit pricing, profit margin, variation images/sub-unit fields, combo variation selection, and custom fields.
- [x] Product form view simplified into an enterprise-style page form with fewer visible panels while keeping code split into maintainable components.
- [x] Product custom fields fixed to use the existing `product` module key, show required markers/errors, and preserve custom-field updates.
- [x] Product custom fields accept `null`/empty-array payloads and blank optional custom-field values are normalized to `null`.
- [x] Product form now shows a top validation alert when client-side validation blocks saving.
- [x] Product detail page added with row View action, product-name breadcrumbs, read-only product profile, variations, combo items, and custom fields.
- [ ] Continue product frontend hardening with detail-view polish and any packaging workflow only after confirming implemented backend routes.

## Important Reminders

- `AGENTS.md` was shortened to main points only and now references the actual `Docs/v11-split/00-INDEX.md` filename.
- Before code changes, read `Docs/v11-split/ERP_Master_Build_Plan_v10.md` and `Docs/v11-split/ERP_Master_Build_Plan_v11.md`.
- New frontend user-facing text must be translated in both English and Khmer. Do not leave Khmer files with English placeholders.
- Reuse existing frontend patterns for pages, forms, API hooks, schemas, table states, dialogs, and toasts.
- Large forms or controls, especially Products, should use dedicated pages rather than modal dialogs.
- Product forms should use a clean enterprise page layout from current project patterns and product workflow needs, not copy the old frontend layout one-to-one.
- Before building or changing a UI control, check existing components and feature patterns first, then reuse the closest pattern when it fits.
- For form changes, mark required fields visibly and add/update focused tests for the validation contract when a test setup exists.
